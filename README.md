## Snapshot

- I build end‑to‑end analytics and GenAI systems: data pipelines → models → APIs/UI → eval/observability → deployment.
- Tooling I lean on: Python, SQL, scikit‑learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, LangChain, Hugging Face, FastAPI, Streamlit, MLflow, Docker, AWS.
- What teams get from me: grounded results, clean code, measurable business impact, and docs that drive adoption.

### Impact highlights
- +40% landing‑page conversions via experimentation and UX audits (Manito Mix)
- 2.4× ROAS with lower CPA on $150K+ annual budget (Manito Mix); 3× ROAS on $200K+ (Kissflow)
- −12% excess inventory, +7% service levels from SKU‑level forecasting (P&G)
- −60% reporting time via automated, client‑ready dashboards
